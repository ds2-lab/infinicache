1) Multikey with LowLevelKeys Replication Operations

    EXPERIMENT (1.1)
    - 500 Consecutive mkSET requests followed by 500 Consecutive rGET requests -
    - low-level-value-size = 160 B (the same as the average size of Fraudio's data)
    - for each SET we set a  high-level-key which contains 9 low-level-keys (1404 B in total)
    - for each GET we retrieve 3 low-level key-value pairs (480 B)
    Average mkSET time:  5.381147e+06
    Average mkGET time:  6.844392e+07

    EXPERIMENT (1.2)
    - 1000 Consecutive mkSET requests followed by 1000 Consecutive rGET requests -
    - low-level-value-size = 160 B (the same as the average size of Fraudio's data)
    - for each SET we set a  high-level-key which contains 9 low-level-keys (1404 B in total)
    - for each GET we retrieve 3 low-level key-value pairs (480 B)
    Average mkSET time:  4.9947485e+06
    Average mkGET time:  2.1112165e+08

    EXPERIMENT (1.3)
    - same as 1.2 but with low-level-value-size = 1313 B which is the max value for Fraudio's Data


2) Simple Replication Operations

    EXPERIMENT (2.1)
    - 500 Consecutive rSET requests followed by 500 Consecutive rGET requests -
    - low-level-value-size = 2 Bytes (first test)
    Average rSET time:  4.516564e+06 ms
    Average rGET time:  2.570904e+06 ms

    EXPERIMENT (2.2)
    - 1000 Consecutive rSET requests followed by 1000 Consecutive rGET requests -
    - low-level-value-size = 160 B (the same as the average size of Fraudio's data)
    Average mkSET time:  4.3145145e+06
    Average mkGET time:  2.387181e+06

3) Original Erasure Coding Operations

    EXPERIMENT (3.1)
    - 500 Consecutive SET requests followed by 500 Consecutive GET requests -
    - value-size = 160 Bytes
    Average SET time:  6.676049121756492
    Average GET time:  159.64132920758456

    EXPERIMENT (3.2)
    - 1000 Consecutive SET requests followed by 1000 Consecutive GET requests -
    - value size = 160 Bytes
    Average SET time:  6.410645341658353
    Average GET time:  169.11462692007993


    EXPERIMENT (3.3)
    - tries to simulate the Multikey operation
    - basically we assume that every time we need to save data into the cache
    we need to SET 9 key-value pairs (we replicate the Multi Key operation)
    - then when we need to retrieve data, we need to GET 3 key-value pairs (480 B)
    Average GET time:  500.924516480519
    Average SET time:  62.18107363036967
