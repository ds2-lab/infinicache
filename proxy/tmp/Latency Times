Simple Replication

    - 500 Consecutive rSET requests followed by 500 Consecutive rGET requests -
    - low-level-value-size = 2 Bytes (first test)
    Average rSET time:  4.516564e+06 ms
    Average rGET time:  2.570904e+06 ms

Multikey Operations

    - 500 Consecutive mkSET requests followed by 500 Consecutive rGET requests -
    - low-level-value-size = 160 B (the same as the average size of Fraudio's data)
    Average mkSET time:  5.381147e+06
    Average mkGET time:  6.844392e+07
